# BetterSave
Backup Geometry Dash Save to the Servers on close

# Installing

Megahack: Place file in the Megahack v6/v7 Extensions folder
HackerMode, ProxyDLLLoader, and other Adaf DLL loaders, place in the Adaf dll folder

#Note

Your save MUST be small enough to send to the GD servers, else it WILL fail to save, be sure to check by saving normally in game. 
When closing the game, it may take a second for the game to close in the background as it is saving, meaning you wont be able to quickly close and reopen Geometry Dash, you will have to wait for the save to finish.
